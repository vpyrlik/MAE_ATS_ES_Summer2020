 - For student version go to [pricing > student version lite](https://www.eviews.com/EViews11/EViews11Univ/evuniv11.html)
 
 - Why *"lite"*? .rmk[Check out the table on the page above!]
 
--

 - Installation is pretty easy, just follow the instructions.
 
 - Be sure you have access to the folders EViews is about to use

#Recommended Resources

---
class: animated, fadeIn
##EViews documentation

 - Consider the **EViews User's Guide** as a major textbook in econometrics, not only the soft itself

--

 - Whatever can be done with data in EViews has a corresponding section in the documentation
 
--
 
 - The documentation covers not only the technicalities of the soft usage, but also econometrics theory, including references to the books and other literature

--

 - let's see some examples in .rmk[Help > EViews Help Topics] .bb[F1]
 
---
class: animated, fadeIn
##Some online resources

 - [Official online EViews tutorials (slides)](http://www.eviews.com/Learning/index.html) .rmk[Help > Online Tutorials]

--

 - many online courses, e.g., [edX & IMF Macroec Forecasting](https://www.edx.org/course/macroeconometric-forecasting-2)
